# Project1
Hospital Data

## Synopsis
This project shows a database of a hypothetical hospital, it's patients, doctors, payments, appointments, etc, and is a reliable, efficient program using GUI's to sort out various appointments, medical conditions, etc. 

## Motivation
I wanted to create something helpful and simple, in hopes of gaining attention of my skills and job opportunities. 

## How to run
Download and open the zip file and click on the .java file. Then proceed to click run.

## Code Example
JFrame frame = new JFrame("Hospital Data");
        JPanel panel = new JPanel();
        panel.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        JLabel label = new JLabel("Select a data function");

        This line of code is important because it's the beginnings of the projects' capabilities.

## Test
1. Download the zip file
2. Extract it
3. Find the file named com.company until you find the .java file
4. When HospitalData.java is found, simply click run and add any changes/comments you like to the code
